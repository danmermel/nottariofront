The Internet has created unprecedented opportunities for people to create and share on a global scale. That has mostly been a good thing.

But it has also allowed people to take the creations of others with trivial simplicity. Think of how how easy it is to right-click on an image, save it to your desktop and use on your next presentation or flyer for your local event. This is technically a breach of copyright, yet it is happening countless times every day.

The answer is not necessarily to stop sharing (although some people do that), but to find ways to make sure that you can prove that you originated a certain piece of content if it ever were to come to a dispute about ownership.

Similarly, in offline scenarios, as a creator you may have to share your ideas or your designs with others in order to get them to the next stage. Imagine that you design some furniture and take it to a manufacturer to see if they can make it. They reject it, but a year later you see your designs appear in the shops! How do you prove that they copied you, that you were the original creator?
If you are a big player with lots of money, then you can get into [big, expensive lawsuits](https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/top-5-intellectual-property-disputes). But what if you are not?

## Enter Nottario

Nottario can help you build a case. If you take your design files and obtain a Notarisation Certificate for them, you can prove that at the time you created the certificate you were in possession of those files.

That is because the combination of a timestamp on the Ethereum blockchain with the digital fingerprint of your document is a unique event that can occur only at a given time and only with your document.

And the Notarisation Certificate allows you, or anyone else, to validate your design document against the record that exists in the Ethereum blockchain.

So unless someone has the same document and can prove that they had it before you, you have a strong case to be seen as the original creator.

In later posts we will be discussing in more detail what a digital fingerprint is, how it manages not to reveal any information about your actual documents,  and why we use Ethereum as our blockchain register. In the meantime, why not  [give Nottario a try](https://nottar.io/drop.html) right now?
