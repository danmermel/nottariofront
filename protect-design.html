    <p>If you have invested time and effort designing something (a piece of furniture or a new kitchen product), you don't want to see it plagiarised by some opportunist trying to make a fast buck.</p>
    <p>But often you can't help sharing your design in its early stages, or parts of it, in oder to get feedback or get to the next stage of the process. You may take it to a manufacturer, they may tell you they don't want to or can't make it. A year later, you see the same design being sold in the shops!</p>
    <p>So how do you protect yourself from theft of your intellectual property?</p>
    <p>If it comes down to a dispute about who came up with the design idea, who had it first, Nottario can help you.</p>
    <p>Nottario is a service that allows you to get a proof that you had a document (a design drawing for example) at a certain point in time, by using the <a href="ethereum.html">Ethereum blockchain</a>.</p>
    <h3> How does it work?</h3> 
    <h4>Identity</h4> 
    <p>Any electronic document (Word, Excel, PDF, jpg or anything else) has a unique <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function" target="_new">"digital fingerprint"</a>. It is unique to that document and that document only. If you make even the tiniest change to the document (remove a comma in a contract, for example), the new document's fingerprint will be completely different. By digitally fingerprinting your document you are obtaining a unique identifier for it, without actually revealing any information about the document itself.</p>
    <h4>Timestamp</h4>
    <p>By submitting your document's fingerprint in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract" target="_new">Smart Contract</a> to the <a href="ethereum.html">Ethereum blockchain</a> (the fingerprint, remember, NOT the document itself), you are obtaining an unforgeable timestamp for your action, because every block in the blockchain has a timestamp and that timestamp cannot be altered.  (See, for example, <a href="https://etherscan.io/block/3907186" target="_new">this block's timestamp</a>)</p>
    <p>The combination of those two things (the fingerprint in the Smart Contract and the timestamp from the blockchain) means that you can point to a document in your possession and to the smart contract on the blockchain, and assert that you have had that document since at least that particular point in time.</p>
    <p>And, because the data in the blockchain is readable and publicly accessible, anyone can verify your claim. They can read the Smart Contract, extract the fingerprint and compare it to the fingerprint of the document in your possession. If the two fingerprints are the same, the two documents must be the same.
    <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
    <p>You can notarise any document of any type and any size for <strong>just {{ site.stripe_visible_price }}</strong>.
    <h3>I like it! What do I do?</h3>
    <p>Click the button below and simply drag and drop your document into the dropzone. Remember, <strong>your document stays with you</strong>. ONLY the fingerprint gets uploaded to the public internet. <strong>Nottario</strong>  does not even copy your document to its servers because the fingerprint calculation is performed by your browser on your machine. Your document never leaves your computer.</p>
    <p>Then follow the payment instructions. Once your payment has been accepted your document fingerprint will be on its way to the Ethereum blockchain and you will get your online Notarisation Certificate!</p>
    <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Wait until the transaction has been processed. This can take up to a minute. You will be redirected to a page with a web URL like this <a href="https://nottar.io/certificate.html?0x00754F4C707383DFb13c54AbBA0e16A59c001210">https://nottar.io/certificate.html?0x00754F...</a>. This is your certificate page and you can always come back to it.</p>
    <p>The last bit of that web URL is the address of your Smart Contract on the blockchain. Keep a note of it. Even if we go out of business you will always be able to access the Smart Contract. <a href="forever.html">This page</a> gives you more details on how to do that.</p>
